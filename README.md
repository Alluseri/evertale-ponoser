3 minor updates, no fix, I'm back.

## disclaimer
I'm not responsible for what others do with this software. As for me, I'm not guilty because it's the devs' fault they couldn't counter a 15 year old abusing their APIs like wild shit.

## node modules
* zlib
* uuid
* ws
* node-fetch@2.6.7
* i forgor

## how fix?
1. Fix restore codes
2. Changing the compression especially to a headerless one would throw me off for long enough
3. Encrypting or signing packets(I don't like working with IL2CPP)
4. Account staging

## credits
* [emanuele-f & contributors](https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid) for their wonderful piece of software called PCAPdroid. It would be straight up impossible without them.

They didn't even get my age right. I'm 15, not 14. Alex, btw, nice to meet you. I'm sooo doing it again now, thanks Rayne for motivation, you're the one to blame now. Make sure to mention this github repo in one of your future tweets :pleading_face:

## other than that
enjoy!
