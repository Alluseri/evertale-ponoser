3 minor updates, no fix, I'm back.

## disclaimer
I'm not responsible for what others do with this software. As for me, I'm not guilty because it's the devs' fault they couldn't counter a 15 year old abusing their APIs like wild shit.

## node modules
* zlib
* uuid
* ws
* node-fetch@2.6.7
* i forgor

## how fix?
1. Fix restore codes
2. Changing the compression especially to a headerless one would throw me off for long enough
3. Encrypting or signing packets(I don't like working with IL2CPP)
4. Account staging

## credits
* [emanuele-f & contributors](https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid) for their wonderful piece of software called PCAPdroid. It would be straight up impossible without them.
* I don't remember.

## other than that
enjoy!
